Change - by Kris Xiong

Change will come no matter what I do,
but maybe not if I close my eyes.
Change won’t find us if I’m still, like Death,
holding onto Niam’s hand, a lifeline.

“Me ab, look, before I close my eyes.”
I see her eyes are still bright. Don’t cry.
Niam’s hand hold onto mine, her lifeline.
Where did all the time go? I want more.

Her eyes are bright, “don’t cry.” She still sees
that her me ab is right here with her.
“I want more time. Where did it all go?”
And all I can do is smile, saying

that “your me ab is right here with you.”
Change will find us, like Death, but I’m still
Smiling. And all I can do is say
“change will come no matter what I do.”
