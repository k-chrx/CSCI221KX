Happiness - by Kris Xiong

What does it feel like? Let me tell you.
It feels like laughing so hard that you cry.
Like a feeling so warm and so true
that winter can’t freeze it, though it may try.

It’s a hot shower pouring over you 
or a free meal when you feel like you’ll cry.
Like completing something long overdue,
it gives you the ability to fly.

It’s those that will still have you
despite the pain and the tears that you cry.
It makes you look at life like it’s new.
This feeling is something you can’t deny.
